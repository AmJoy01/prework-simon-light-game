## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   W3Schools, Google for the color codes, <a href="http://colormind.io/">Colormind</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">Piano key frequencies</a>

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   The randomization part gave me a hard time. I would say it took me hours to figure out where to place the code. I had to look up my old code from over the summer and some other resources online to figure out the syntax for JavaScript.
   I've mostly code in Java, so figuring out the logic wasn't hard. I know in Java to rearrange memory in an array, you would have to for loop and initialize a temp variable to place the old index somewhere while you sort the other variables.
   Like juggling or just placing your phone down on the table, so you can pick up your drink with that same hand.
   Another challenge for me was how I would want my website to look. When it comes to design, I'm simple. I've always been the logical type: wanting to know how things work.
   I'm also hard on myself because I would really want to <i>WOW</i> clients, friends, and family on my design. Digital Art is a recent hobby of mine, so you can already tell how
   many times I press CTRL+Z during a drawing session. I used a website to pick 3 simple colors, and just stuck with that for the rest of the project. The closer I get to the application
   deadline, the more ideas pop into my head.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   Do you draw out what you want your website to look like before coding?
   Why are we using HTML/CSS, and JavaScript for this project and not any of the other coding languages?
   What other coding languages are companies utilizing and want their web developers to use?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  
   I would focus more on the front-end. I want it look unique from the other projects. I was thinking about making it a cat memory game. Each button represent a different
   cat sound. Maybe some cat animations for each button when it plays back. I would also want a victory song. Maybe the meow mix song at the end when the user enters the
   correct buttons flawlessly. 
   If I had enough time, I would want to adjust the speed and difficulty of the game by adding different level buttons. I would also like to add a menu so I can multiple
   memory games based on the themes(like animal, science, music or etc.) the user chooses.
